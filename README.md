# Anthropologist
I am Professor in the [Department of Anthropology](https://www.boisestate.edu/anthropology/) at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho, USA. My current research projects include [NSF EAGER DLC SaTC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2210082) and [NSF NNA](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2126794). I am also a contributor to the [ENDOW](https://endowproject.github.io/) project. My research focuses on social networks and cooperation, climate change adaptation, resilience of youth, and the dynamics of wealth inequality.
