# Anthropologist
I am Professor in the [Department of Anthropology](https://www.boisestate.edu/anthropology/) at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho, USA. 

I conducted ethnographic research in northern Siberia in the 1990s and eary 2000s. My book [_Peoples of the Tundra_](https://www.waveland.com/browse.php?t=30) summarizes that work.

My current research projects include [NSF EAGER DLC SaTC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2210082) and [NSF NNA](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2126794). I am also a contributor to the [ENDOW](https://endowproject.github.io/) project. My research focuses on social networks and cooperation, climate change adaptation, resilience of youth, and the dynamics of wealth inequality. More about my academic record can be found at my[ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-5594).

I use and teach multiple methods in my research include participant observation and ethnography, experimental games, reproductive histories and demography, and social network analysis.
