I am Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho, USA. My current research projects include NSF EAGER, NSF NNA, and ONR MURI. I am also a contributor to ENDOW. My research focuses on social networks and cooperation, climate change adaptation, wealth inequality, and resilience of youth.
