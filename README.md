# Anthropologist
I am Professor in the [Department of Anthropology](https://www.boisestate.edu/anthropology/) at Boise State University in Boise, Idaho, USA. 

I conducted ethnographic research in northern Siberia in the 1990s and eary 2000s. My book [_Peoples of the Tundra_](https://www.waveland.com/browse.php?t=30) summarizes that work.

My current research projects include [NSF EAGER DLC SaTC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2210082) and [NSF NNA](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2126794). I am also a contributor to the [ENDOW](https://endowproject.github.io/) project, where I am conducting research in central Mozambique with Sena people. 

My research focuses on social networks and cooperation, climate change adaptation, resilience of youth, and the dynamics of wealth inequality. More about my academic record can be found on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9059-5594) page. My department webpage can be found [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/anthropology/our-team/directory/john-ziker/).

I use and teach multiple methods in my research include participant observation and ethnography, experimental games, reproductive histories and demography, and social network analysis.

I am an advocate for reproducible science and encourage my students to learn R, LaTeX, and other tools to improve workflows.
